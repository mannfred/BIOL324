# Boraginaceae

**Borage Family**

---

**1.  Herbs (some tropical species are trees or shrubs)**  
**2.  Leaves simple, alternate, commonly hairy, without stipules.**  
**3.	Flowers perfect, usually actinomorphic, usually borne in a scorpioid or helicoid cyme (drepanium).  Sepals 5, free or partially fused.  Petals 5, fused.  Stamens 5, epipetalous.  Pistil compound, ovary superior, carpels 2, but deeply lobed, appearing as 4, style gynobasic, placentation basal.**  
**4.  Fruit 4 nutlets.**  
**5.  About 100 genera and 2000 species, widely distributed.**  

The Boraginaceae is the 17th largest family in B.C., with 51 species and varieties.  A few members of the family are cultivated ornamentals.

## Leaves

Boraginaceae does not have super distinctive leaf characteristics - they are typically simple, alternate, and lacking stipules. One good character, however, is that they tend to be covered in stiff (and irritating to touch!) trichomes. These trichomes cover most vegetative parts of the plant, including the stems, leaves, peduncles/petioles, and calyxes.

## Flowers

The flowers and inflorescence structure of Boraginaceae are quite distinctive, and once you get the visual in your mind it should be fairly easy to narrow down to this family. The flowers are usually actinomorphic, with 5 sepals, 5 fused petals, and 5 stamens. In addition, there are often corolla appendages (aka fornix) forming a ring around the throat of the flower. You can see the fornices quite well in the *Myositis* sp. (Forge-me-nots) below.

<p align="center">
![](./media/Boraginaceae3.jpeg){width=100%}
</p>

</br>

Here's another example from *Anchusa* sp.

<p align="center">
![](./media/Boraginaceae4.jpeg){width=100%}
</p>

</br>

*Borago officinalis* (Borage) takes the corolla appendages to the next level, forming two fornices on each petal (instead of the single fornix that is usually present). The inner fornix takes the shape of a tower or pedestal, with epipetalous stamens emerging from the inner curve of the fornix. Examine the below pictures (use the family diagrams to help you), and see if you can identify the different parts of the Borage flower.

Here you can see a close-up of the inner fornix with the stamen attached.

</br>

---

Another good characteristic for this family is the inflorescence type. Members of the Boraginaceae have helicoid or scorpioid cymes (see the family diagram for cartoons of what these look like). The development of the flowers spatially and temporally tend to give the inflorescence a coiled look, quite like a fern fiddlehead or a scorpion's tail (hence "scorpioid" cyme). For the purposes of our lab, we won't be asking you to differentiate between scorpioid vs helicoid cymes, but getting an appreciation for what they look like can help you identify this family in the field (or narrow down to Boraginaceae in a family ID quiz). Here are some examples:

</p>

</br>

---

## Fruit

Similar to the Lamiaceae, members of the Boraginaceae typically form nutlets as their fruit type. They form four nutlets from two carpels, with a gynobasic style attached at the base and emerging from the center of the four nutlets. The nutlets also often have a thickened rim at the base. Here you can see a flower with 3 developed nutlets (the fourth has already fallen out):

<p align="center">

</br>

And here you can see the depressions that the thickened rims of the nutlets made in the receptacle of the flower.

# Solanaceae

**Potato or Nightshade Family**

**1.  Herbs, vines, shrubs, or trees.**  
**2.  Leaves simple or occasionally pinnately lobed to compound, alternate, without stipules.**  
**3.  Flowers perfect, actinomorphic or sometimes zygomorphic.  Sepals 5, fused.  Petals 5, fused.  Stamens 2, 4, or usually 5, epipetalous, sometimes with anthers connivent (converging or coming together but not fused).  Pistil compound, ovary superior, carpels 2, placentation axile.**  
**4.  Fruit a berry or capsule.**  
**5.  About 85 genera and more than 2200 species, primarily in tropical America.**  

The Solanaceae is not a significant family in the flora of B. C., but it is one of the most important in agriculture, providing foods and drugs.  Important crops include *Solanum* (potato, eggplant, tomato), *Physalis* (tomatillo, ground cherry), *Capsicum* (red, yellow, and green peppers), and *Nicotiana* (tobacco).  Many species produce poisonous alkaloids.  Alkaloids from *Atropa* (deadly nightshade or belladonna), *Hyoscyamus* (henbane), *Datura*, *Mandragor*a (mandrake), and *Brunfelsia* are used as drugs, hallucinogens, and poisons.  *Petunia* is the most important ornamental member of the Solanaceae in temperate regions.

## Flowers

Members of the Solanaceae are characterized by 5 fused sepals and petals, and typically actinomorphic flowers. Corollas tend to be either wheel-shaped (rotate), trumpet-shaped (salverform), or funnel-shaped (funnelform). See if you can identify these different corolla shapes in the flowers below.

</p>

<br>

*Datura* sp.

<p align="center">
![](./media/Solanaceae3.jpg){width=100%}
</p>

<br>

---

The Solanaceae tend to have 5 epipetalous stamens (but can also have 2 or 4 stamens). Sometimes, the anthers are "connivent" (converging or pressed together but normally not fused) around the style. The anthers also have poricidal dehiscence (do you remember the type of pollination mechanism and previous family we've seen this in?).

You can see connivent anthers and poricidal dehiscence (zoom in to see the pores) quite well in the potato (*Solanum* sp.) flower below.

<p align="center">
![](./media/Solanaceae4.jpeg){width=100%}
</p>

<br>

---

## Fruit

Most members of the Solanacae that you are likely to be familiar with have berries as their fruit type. You've examined tomato fruit already. Do you remember the placentation type, number of carpels, and number of locules?

<p align="center">
![](./media/basic_7.jpeg){width=100%}
</p>

<br>

Peppers (in the genus *Capsicum*) are also berries. Most Solanaceae fruit are formed from 2 carpels, but there can be 3 or 4 in *Capsicum*.

# Apiaceae - Carrot Family

---

**1.	Mostly herbs.**  
**2.	Leaves usually compound, alternate, without stipules, but usually the petiole has a sheathing base.**  
**3.	Flowers usually perfect or andromonoecious (perfect and male on the same plant), radially symmetrical.  Sepals 5, usually small and sometimes absent.   Petals 5 (0), not fused.  Stamens  5, free.  Pistil compound, ovary inferior, carpels 2, placentation axile.  Inflorescence an umbel.**  
**4.	Fruit a schizocarp.**  
**5.	About 300 genera and 3000 species, mainly in north temperate regions.**  

The Apiaceae is the 13th largest family in B.C., with 61 taxa occurring in the province.  The family is easily recognized by its usually compound leaves, umbellate inflorescence, 5-merous flowers with an inferior ovary, and distinctive fruit, but genera and species are often difficult to identify.  Many keys require mature fruits for definite identification.  The plants and especially fruits often contain aromatic oils, which are used as flavorings.  Many species are edible, but some are deadly poisonous, including the poison hemlock with which Socrates was executed.

Cultivated crops, herbs, and spices include *Apium* (celery, celeriac), *Pastinaca* (parsnip), *Daucus* (carrot), *Foeniculum* (fennel), *Anethum* (dill), *Cuminum* (cumin), *Pimpinella* (anise), *Petroselinum* (parsley), *Carum* (caraway), and *Coriandrum* (coriander, Chinese parsley, or cilantro).

## Leaves

Members of the Apiaceae are characterized by having alternate leaves that are compound and rather dissected (think parsley and cilantro...yum!). Sometimes the leaves are dissected to the point of being thread-like linear filaments. In addition, the leaves quite often have a dilated, sheathing petiole (just like celery!). Here are some examples:

Can you see the dilated, sheating petiole below?

</p>

<br>

---

## Flowers

Apiaceae flower and inflorescence structure is fairly consistent and unique, which, in combination with the leaf and fruit characteristics, make it easy to identify this family. Within the family, however, it can be quite difficult to identify genera and species because they all look pretty similar. Your typical Apiaceae flower is small, white or yellow, actinomorphic, and with 5 free sepals, petals, and stamens. The ovary is inferior, and the two short styles often have expanded bases forming a disk or cone-shaped structure that the styles sit on (a "stylopodium" - not easy to see in the photos below as the flowers are so small). Here are some photos:

</p>

<br>

---

A more obvious character than the tiny flowers (which usually require some magnification to make out their features) is the inflorescence structure, which is called an "umbel" (the old name for the Apiaceae was the "Umbelliferae"). An umbel has flowers arranged on pedicils of more or less equal length all arising from a central point, similar to the ribs of an umbrella. Umbels can be simple or more often compound, with "rays" emerging from the end of the peduncle and then pedicels emerging centrally from the end of each ray to form "umbellets". Quite often the umbel will be subtended by bracts at the base (an "involucre"), and if compound, the umbellets will often be subtended by their own bracts ("involucels"). Look at these photos of umbels, and see if you can identify whether each is simple or compound, and whether involucres and involucels are present.

## Fruit

Apiaceae have very cool looking fruits, especially when examined using some magnification. The fruit are schizocarps (remember these from Malvaceae?) that split into two mericarps. The mericarps remain attached by a slender Y-shaped stalk called a "carpophore" from which they dangle and eventually fall off. The contiguous faces of the mericarps (where they were originally united) is an "imaginary" line called the "commissure". Each mericarp can have vertical lines called "nerves" and dark splotches ("oil tubes") in intervals between the nerves. Some schizocarps are even adorned with spiky barbs. Can you identify these different features in pictures below?

<p align="center">

</p>

<br>

<p align="center">
![](./media/Apiaceae15.jpeg){width=49%} ![](./media/Apiaceae14.jpeg){width=49%}
</p>

<br>

Similar to Brassicaceae fruits, Apiaceae fruits can be compressed in two different ways: "laterally" which results in a short commissure, and "dorsally" which produces a long commissure. Laterally compressed schizocarps tend to have more wide and chunky mericarps, while dorsally compressed schizocarps tend to have flat and thin mericarps. Can you tell which is which from the examples below?

# R Activity 2

**Mapping Species Distributions using R and GBIF**

---

## Motivation

At its core, plant taxonomy is the science of naming and grouping plants based on their shared traits. Throughout this course we've seen how growth habit, morphology, and geographic distribution can provide valuable information about how to classify and define plants. When we consider geographic information, we are asking questions like "do the plants occupy similar or distinct habitats?" and "are the ranges of these plants disjunct or overlapping?". Depending on the answer to these questions, our decision to group or separate plants (and give them different names) can be changed dramatically. In this R activity, we'll demonstrate how we can use publicly available occurrence data to create our very own distribution maps for plants and use these maps to compare the geographic ranges of species you've found in the field.

## Mapping Species Distributions

In previous labs we familiarized ourselves with GBIF, R, and RStudio. Today we'll be running a script that collects, filters, and maps distribution data for five species of "prickly pear" cacti (Opuntioideae: Cactaceae):

_Opuntia basilaris_ (Mojave, Colorado, Utah)

_Opuntia fragilis_  (Northwestern)

_Opuntia humifusa_  (Eastern)

_Opuntia polyacantha_ (Great Plains, foothills of Rocky Mtns)

_Opuntia stricta_ (Gulf Coast and Caribbean)

First let's install the required packages. If you have an older version of R, you may need to install them individually, e.g. by running `install.packages("mapr")` and then the next packagage, and so on. 

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("mapr")
install.packages("spocc")
install.packages("taxize")
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

We'll also install the development version of the package `rgbif`:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("rgbif", repos = "https://dev.ropensci.org")
```

These packages are designed for connecting with the GBIF database (`rgbif`, `spocc`, `taxize`), organizing data (`tidyverse`), and mapping (`mapr`). Once installed, use the `library()` function to attach the packages:

```{r, results = 'hide', warning = FALSE, message = FALSE }

library(mapr)
library(spocc)
library(taxize)
library(tidyverse)
library(rgbif)

```


Now let's get some occurrence data from GBIF!

```{r}
opuntia_wishlist <-
  c("Opuntia basilaris Engelm. & J.M.Bigelow",
    "Opuntia fragilis (Nutt.) Haw.",
    "Opuntia humifusa Raf.",
    "Opuntia polyacantha Haw.",
    "Opuntia stricta (Haw.) Haw.")
```


In this first step we're creating a list of all of the plant species that we're hoping to get GBIF data for. The `<-` operator stores the results in an object that we named `opuntia_wishlist`. By storing the results in an object we can later return to the object and inspect it, subset it, and pipe it to other functions. In the following step we'll use the `occ()` function to search GBIF for the species records:

```{r}
opuntia_metadata <- 
  occ(query = opuntia_wishlist, from = 'gbif', limit = 500)
```

In this code we've created a new object called `opuntia_metadata`. This object contains occurrence records found by the `occ()` function, where we specified our taxon ID (contained in `opuntia_ids`) and told the function that we wanted our data `from = gbif` (instead of another database) and that we wanted a maximum of `500` records. Let's inspect the structure of the `opuntia_metadata` object:

```{r}
str(opuntia_metadata, max.level=1)
```

The output tells us that `opuntia_metadata` is a `List` object with 9 named elements. We are specifically interested in the named element `$gbif`, so we can simplify our object by subsetting:

```{r}
opuntia_simple <- opuntia_metadata$gbif$data
```

While writing this code, we discovered that the `opuntia_metadata` object is pretty complex and with lots of layers! The code above says to take the large object `opuntia_metadata` and select the element named `$gbif`. Then, within the element `$gbif`, select the sub-element `$data`. Within `$data` there are 5 elements, each one contains the lat-long information for one of our *Opuntia* species.

Let's look at the lat-long data for *O. basilaris*:

```{r}
opuntia_simple$`Opuntia_basilaris_Engelm._&_J.M.Bigelow`
```

The output is pretty big and messy! The output tells us that it's a `tibble` (a type of spreadsheet) with 500 rows and 73 columns. Each row is a record of where _Opuntia basilaris_ has been found or collected. Each column is some information associated with that record. While some of the columns are useful (e.g. the latitude and longitude), most columns aren't needed (we'll get rid of them later). In the next step, we'll combine the five separate `tibbles` into one:

```{r, message = FALSE}

useful_variables <- c("name", "longitude", "latitude", "basisOfRecord", "scientificName")

opuntia_combined <-
  reduce(opuntia_simple, full_join, by = useful_variables) %>% 
  select(useful_variables)

```

Above, we created an object `useful_variables` that has the names of the columns we want in our final dataset. In the next step we used `reduce()` to create one simple, combined dataset with only the columns specified in `useful_variables`. Everything else was discarded. Whew! This is a lot of organizing.. we're almost there. Before we get to mapping, we should check our data for synonyms. The `unique()` function tells us how many unique entries exist within a column:

```{r}
unique(opuntia_combined$scientificName)
```

Unfortunately, lots of synonyms were included in the results. We'll make a object containing the names we want to keep, and use the `filter()` function to get rid of everything else:

```{r}
# filter out synonyms
# filter out entries outside of North America
opuntia_fil <-
  opuntia_combined %>%
  filter(scientificName == opuntia_wishlist) %>%
  filter(longitude < -58 & latitude > 18.1) %>%
  filter(basisOfRecord == "HUMAN_OBSERVATION")
```

We're ready to map! Pick some colours for your species (you can pick your own [from here](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Colors_(ggplot2)/)):

```{r}
mycolors <- c( "#E69F00", "#56B4E9",  "#F0E442", "#D55E00", "#CC79A7")
```

And map using the `map_ggplot()` function:

```{r}
mapr::map_ggplot(opuntia_fil[,1:3], color = mycolors) +
  coord_fixed(xlim = c(-135, -55 ),  ylim = c(10, 90)) +
  ggtitle("Distribution of 5 species of Prickly Pear cacti (Opuntia)")
```


Beauty! After all of that hard work, we'll save the lat-long data object as an .rds file. We'll use this data again in Lab 10. If you downloaded or forked the [BIOL324 folder from the GitHub site](https://github.com/mannfred/BIOL324), you can run this code:


```{r eval = FALSE}
saveRDS(opuntia_fil, file = 'R_scripts/filtered_gbif_dataset.rds')
```

## KNOWLEDGE CHECK 7.4

Using the above code as a template, choose 5 species from your iNaturalist observations and create your own geographic map! Here are some tips:

- Copy and paste the above code into your script to make the *Opuntia* map and make sure everything is working. 
- Modify the code to plot 5 of your iNaturalist species instead. 
  - To find the correct names for the GBIF database, go to the GBIF website and search your species. Find the main entry for your species and copy the entire name verbatim, including the genus, species, and authority.
  - Replace the *Opuntia* species names with your own species.
  - Replace any objects with `Opuntia` in the name with your own object names (e.g. `opuntia_simple`). Try to make it meaningful/descriptive to help yourself remember as you code (`opuntia_simple` doesn't make much sense if you've got 5 different species, none of which are in the genus *Opuntia*!!!).
- If you want to get a little spicy, you can pick your own colors [from here](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Colors_(ggplot2)/) ;-).
- Make your own plot title, and include your name in the title.
