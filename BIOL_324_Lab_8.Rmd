#### Motivation

Throughout this course we've seen how morphology plays a central role in plant taxonomy. The shapes of stems, leaves, and flowers are often the first traits listed in a dichotomous key. When a trait (like corolla width) is measured and quantified, we are able to use statistical tests to decide how to group or split individuals. The science of measuring and analysing shape is called _morphometrics_. In this lab, we'll be using a dataset of _Aquilegia_ flower morphology (see: Lab 1, Ranunculaceae) to determine whether two species, *A. formosa* and *A. flavescens*, show evidence of forming hybrids when co-occuring in a contact zone.

#### Pre-lab

Before starting this week's lab you will have: 

1. downloaded the program [Image_J](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/download.htm) for making morphometric measurements,  <br>

2. downloaded the class google sheet in the file format .csv. Note: if you can’t use imageJ for any reason, don’t panic. Display the digital image of the herbarium sheet on any device and use a ruler held up to the screen to make measurements, <br>

3. **MB**: probably need to get students to do some pre-assignment reading on machine learning (decision trees, random forests). Also, some reading on MDS and interpreting MDS plots.

#### Activity 1: Taking Morphometric Measurements from Herbarium Specimens using ImageJ

ImageJ is an image processing software that was developed by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH). It is used to analyze different types of images but this tutorial will cover how to measure certain morphological features from photographs of herbarium specimens. 

To use ImageJ you have to import the photographs you want to work with. 

1. Drag the file to the lower grey bar. As you are doing this the words <<drag and drop>> should appear. Once the image has been dropped it will open and now it is ready to analyze in ImageJ. 

There are many measurements that can be taken with ImageJ. It might be helpful to click through the different buttons at the top of the bar to explore all of the different ways ImageJ can make measurements. This tutorial will use the line button for all of the measurements. 

2. Zoom in on the ruler (Mac: Command shift =, Windows: CTRL + ). Most digitized herbarium specimens will have a ruler in the photograph. This is to help standardized it and is useful for measuring features in ImageJ. 

3. Use the line button (5th button from the left) and draw a line by clicking and dragging along the bottom of the ruler so that the line goes from the 0 tick to the 5 cm tick. This needs to be very accurate because we are going to use this length to calibrate the rest of the measurements taken in ImageJ. 

4.  Go to the top bar and hit “analyze”. Then go to “set scale…”. Enter 5 into the Known distance box and enter cm into the Unit of Length box. Hit the box “Global”. By checking “Global” you are ensuring that this is applied to all photos in the current session of ImageJ. Then hit OK. ImageJ is now calibrated using the ruler from your herbarium photo. <br>

Now you can go on to take measurements. 

5. Use the line or the segmented line (you can change between them by right clicking on the line button) draw lines across what you want to measure. Once you have the right length hit (Mac: Command M, Windows: CTRL M) and ImageJ will measure and record the length in a convenient table for you. This table should pop up once you take your first measurement. When you have all of the measurements you need you can either download that table that ImageJ made or just copy and input the data in your own table. You will have to eventually input your data in a group spreadsheet (on Canvas) so keep that in mind as you are recording data. <br>

6. Once you have taken and recorded all of the measurements necessary put your findings into the class spreadsheet (Canvas) so that other people will be able to access, download, and use your data for the next step. <br>

Note: [Here is a link](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/guide/user-guide.pdf) to the ImageJ user guide. All the information you will need is in this document, but if you are interested in the program and the other features available, the user guide can provide more information.

#### Activity 2: Delimiting Species using Morphometrics and Machine Learning

Let's get started by attaching the required packages:

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(caret)
library(here)
library(randomForest)
library(RCurl)
library(tidyverse)
```

`randomForest` and `caret` are packages with machine learning tools for classification, regression, and clustering. There are a few ways to implement machine learning. In this lab we will cover using ML in unsupervised mode. This means that the program will have to find the structure of the data itself, without us training it first. 

Now we'll import, subset, and preview the *Aquilegia* morphometric data from Groh et al (2020):

```{r}
columbine_url <- 
  RCurl::getURL('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jgroh/mosaic/master/data/hrbm-pheno-mosaic.csv')

columbine_data_full <- read.csv(text = columbine_url)

columbine_data <-
  columbine_data_full %>% 
  select(1, 3, 12:19)

head(columbine_data)
```

Now, we'll use the `randomForest()` function to analyse and sort our specimens:

```{r}
# run the function randomForest() on our morphometric data.
# ntree tells us how many decision trees to build
# mtry is the amount of variables that will be tested at each node of the tree 
# proximity=TRUE so that the data saves a proximity matrix

rf <- 
  randomForest(
    columbine_data[,-1], 
    ntree=30000, 
    mtry=3, 
    proximity=TRUE, 
    keep.forest=TRUE) 
```

The `randomForest()` function generates 30,000 decision trees (`ntree`) that attempt to classify the specimens based on binary questions posed to the morphometrics data (`columbine_data`). Each question ('node') in the decision tree consideres three morphometric variables (`mtry`). Setting `proximity = TRUE` tells the function to calculate a similarity metric between specimens. This will help us to calculate a distance matrix describing how similar or dissimilar each sample is from one another:

```{r}
distance.matrix <- dist(1 - rf$proximity)
```

Now we'll perform MDS analysis on the distance matrix:
```{r}
mds.analysis <- cmdscale(distance.matrix, eig=TRUE, x.ret=TRUE)

mds.var.per <- round(mds.analysis$eig/sum(mds.analysis$eig)*100, 1)

mds.var.per[1:2]
```

The `cmdscale()` function finds the axes of greatest variation in our morphometrics dataset. For example, if corolla width was the trait that varied the most between all specimens, `cmdscale()` would assign this variable as _MDS axis 1_. In reality, it's unlikely that a single trait will explain the greatest variation in morphology, instead, MDS axes tend to be combinations of traits. In the second step we calculated how much of the total variation of the datset belongs to each of the MDS axes. The third step prints MDS axes 1 and 2, telling us that MDS axis 1 accounts for 42.3% of the morphological variation in the dataset. Each *Aquilegia* specimen exists somewhere in the 'shape space' created by MDS axes 1 and 2. For example, if MDS axes 1 and 2 described variation in corolla and sepal width, respectively, *Aquilegia* specimens with wide corollas and sepals would exist in the upper right corner of this 'shape space'. We'll see what this looks like in the plotting step. We'll store the shape space location of each *Aquilegia* sample in an object called `mds.data`:

```{r}
mds.values <- mds.analysis$points
mds.data <- data.frame(Sample = rownames(mds.values),
                       X = mds.values[,1],
                       Y = mds.values[,2],
                       Status = columbine_data$species.label)
```


Now we can plot each *Aquilegia* specimen in morphometric shape space:

```{r}

mds_plot <- 
  ggplot(
    data = mds.data, 
    aes(x = X, y = Y, label = Sample)) + 
  geom_text(aes(color = Status)) +
  theme_bw() + 
  xlab(paste("MDS1 - ", mds.var.per[1], "%",sep="")) +
  ylab(paste("MDS2 - ", mds.var.per[2], "%",sep="")) +
  ggtitle(" Unsupervised MDS plot using (1 - Random Forest Proximities)") +
  scale_colour_manual(name = "Species", 
                      breaks = c("flavescens", "formosa"), 
                      labels = c(expression(italic("A. flavescens")), 
                                 expression(italic("A. formosa"))),
                      values = c("#009E73", "#CC79A7"))

mds_plot
```

The `ggplot()` function takes our `mds.data` object and plots it. _MDS1_ is the axis explaining the most morphometric variation in our herbarium dataset. Notice that this axis separates _A. flavescens_ and _A. formosa_. 


**-KNOWLEDGE CHECK-**

When an individual specimen has a low *MDS2* value, would it be easier or harder to distinguish the species? If your specimen had a high *MDS2* and *MDS1* value, which *Aquilegia* species is it likely to be?
