  + How labs will go (short intro by teaching team, "plant facing" section followed by "informatics" section)
  + 3 hours long but probably won't take the full time
  + Participation marks and quizzes (to be done within 48 hours of end of lab) each week
  + 2 projects, one for each half of the term
  + For plant facing portion, make labeled drawings (give instructions for drawings)
  + working in groups (zoom breakout rooms)
