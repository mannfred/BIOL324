# Virtual Field Trip to the UBC Botanical Garden

Your instructors will lead the virtual field trip at the beginning of lab. You can find more information about the UBC Botanical Garden [here](https://botanicalgarden.ubc.ca). The Botanical Garden is free for UBC students, and it is currently open if you would like to visit! Just make sure that you sign up for a visitation slot on their website (this is to ensure proper contact tracing during COVID-19).

# Introduction to Flowers

![](media/diagram_basic1.png)

Much of plant taxonomy is concerned with the structure and characteristics of **flowers**. A typical flower contains 4 whorls: **sepals**, **petals**, **stamens**, and **carpels (pistils)** (in that order from the outside to the inside of the flower). The sepals are often green (but are often petaloid as well as you will see), and serve to protect the flower as it is developing in bud. The petals are the primary attractive feature of the flower, and function to attract pollinators (that is why wind-pollinated plants do not usually have showy flowers). The stamens are the male reproductive structures of the flower, producing pollen inside the anthers. The carpels/pistils are the female reproductive structures, and house the ovules inside of the ovary (we will go more into the difference between carpels and pistils in Lab 2). 

Flowers are only produced during certain times of year (differing from species to species). Pollinators will visit the flower (often in search of nectar), get covered in pollen during their visit, and deposit pollen onto the stigma (receptive surface of the pistil) upon visiting the next flower. The pollen grains will germinate on the stigma and grow pollen tubes down the style, delivering sperm to the ovules inside the ovary. Once the ovules have been fertilized, they will develop into seeds, and the ovary will develop into a fruit (often swelling to a much larger size and in some cases changing shape).

**-KNOWLEDGE CHECK-**

Using the terms in the above diagram and your **imagination**, make a drawing of a flower completely new to science. It is OK if it is inspired by a real flower, and it is OK to make it as wild looking as you want, *as long as it follows the morphological rules described above*. It should have all 4 whorls in the proper order, and you should label your drawing with all of the terms in the above diagram. In addition, make a second drawing depicting the flower once the fruit has formed (hint: what organ transforms into the fruit after fertilization occurs, and what happens to the other whorls?).

# Introduction to iNaturalist

**iNaturalist** is an amazing tool for documenting biodiversity through citizen science (the collection and analysis of data relating to the natural world by members of the general public). While we will be using it to document plants, iNaturalist can be used to catalog pretty much any organism you can think of. It works by users making **observations** (typically in the form of pictures, but you can submit sounds if you're observing a bird). With the photographs and geographic information (GPS coordinates) provided by the user, iNaturalist uses [machine learning](https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/computer_vision_demo) to provide ID suggestions. Typically, it will suggest a genus, and then list a series of species suggestions based on visual similarity and/or the presence of nearby observations. Once an observation has been uploaded to iNaturalist, other users can confirm the ID or provide an alternate species ID if they disagree. Once an observation has been identified to species by at least two people (and there are no dissenting opinions / disagreements on the observation), the observation is upgraded from "Needs ID" to "Research Grade".

Because iNaturalist observations are amassed via citizen science (by many people who are not expert taxonomists), data quality is an important issue. The requirement for confirmation to attain "Research Grade" helps with this, but there are several things you can do as well to submit high quality observations: 

- Take multiple photos, one of the flowers and/or fruit (both is ideal), one of the leaves, and one of the whole plant. Sometimes additional pictures are helpful for correct identification, such as the abaxial (underside) of leaves if the upper and lower surface differ. 
- Always include GPS information with your observation. This will help aid in identification and contribute to more complete species maps in the iNaturalist database.
- Put descriptive information in the "notes" field to highlight things not evident in the pictures. This can include information about the local habitat/ecology, the number of individuals found in the population, and the presence of botanical characteristics useful for navigating that group's taxonomic key.
