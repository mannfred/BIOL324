#### Motivation

In Labs 7 and 9 we learned how to map species distributions using GBIF data, and how to create phylogenies from DNA sequence data from GenBank. In this final R assignment, we'll combine these methods to create a phylogeographic map of five _Opuntia_ species. By overlaying a phylogeny onto a species distribution map, we can not only better test taxonomic and evolutionary relationships, but also infer migration and colonization histories.

#### Prerequisites 

Before starting this week's tutorial you will have: 

1. completed R Assignment 2 (Mapping) and Assignment 4 (Phylogenetics), 

2. completed some pre-assignment reading on the use of phylogeography in plant taxonomy, 

3. more...

#### Outcomes

By the end of this tutorial you will have: <br>

1. the ability to combine distribution data from GBIF with sequence data from Genbank to create phylogeographic maps of species distributions,

2. more...

#### Activity 1: Creating a Phylogeographic Map from GBIF and Genbank Data

In previous Assignments we mapped species distributions and constructed phylogenetic trees. In this Assignment, we'll combine both lines of research to simultaneously visualize the phylogenetic and geographic relationships of five _Opuntia_ species.

In this lab, we'll explore further the genus _Opuntia_: 

_Opuntia basilaris_ (Mojave, Colorado, Utah)
_Opuntia fragilis_  (Northwestern) 
_Opuntia humifusa_  (Eastern) 
_Opuntia polyacantha_ (Great Plains, foothills of Rocky Mtns) 
_Opuntia stricta_ (Gulf Coast and Caribbean)

Let's start by installing the necessary packages. `mapdata` is an slightly more sophisticated package than `mapr` (which we used in Lab 7) &mdash; this will allow us to overlay a phylogeny onto a biogeographic plot. `phytools` is a similar phylogenetics package to `ape` (Lab 9), but contains functions for overlaying phylogenies onto maps. `viridis` is a package for creating custom colour schemes &mdash; our maps gotta look fresh! 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c('mapdata', 'phytools', 'viridis'))
```

Attach the packages:

```{r, results = 'hide', warning = FALSE, message = FALSE }
# attach packages once they are installed 
library(here)
library(mapdata)
library(phytools)
library(tidyverse)
library(viridis)
```

Start by importing your species distribution data (from GBIF, Assignment 2) and your phylogenetic tree (Assignment 4). By highlighting and running the entire script, the data are combined and plotted:

```{r}
# import Opuntia rbcL tree from last tutorial
rbcL_tree <- readRDS(file = here('R_scripts/rbcL_tree.rds'))

# import filtered GBIF data from last tutorial
opuntia_fil <- readRDS(file = here('Tutorial_5_Phylogeography/filtered_gbif_dataset.rds')) 
```

#### Activity 2: Deciphering some code

Let's step through the script in order to understand what is happening here. 

<br>

**Lines 14-18**: The `library()` function loads various packages designed specifically for organizing data (`tidyverse`), creating custom colour palettes (`viridis`), and mapping (`mapdata`, `phytools`).

**Lines 24-27**: Import your GBIF and phylogenetic data from previous assignments.

**Lines 30-38**: To reduce clutter in our plot, we'll rename the rows in our dataframe with shortened versions of the species' names. 

**Lines 41-44**: We'll extract the latitude and longitude information from our larger dataframe, and store it as a `matrix` style object. (This is because `phytools::phylo.to.map()` can only handle lat-long info of the `matrix` class.)

**Line 50**: Here, we're removing any rows that have missing lat-long information (NAs). 

**Line 53**: In order to combine the phylogenetic and distribution data, both data objects need to have the species names in the same format. 

**Lines 71-81**: The `phytools::phylo.to.map()` function combines our distribution data `latlong` with our phylogenetic tree `con_tree_rooted`. We use the `regions` parameter to specify what parts of the world to plot, and we'll use the 'Hi-resolution World' setting under `database`. 

**Lines 84-92**: We can plot our combined dataset using the `phytools::plot()` function.

<br>
<br>

**Lines 84-92**: In this example, we've set `cex.points` to zero, which tells the plotting function not to plots circles at each lat-long location. This can make our map a bit cleaner when plotting hulls.
